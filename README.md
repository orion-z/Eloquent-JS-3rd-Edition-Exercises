Eloquent JS 3rd Edition Exercises

My proposed solutions to the exercises in the 3rd edition of Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke. 

I am posting this in February 2018, while the 3rd edition is still a draft.

It is far from complete. I started on Chapter 2, some exercises in Chapter 4 & 5 are not correct. You will find them commented out with an explanation, as to maybe give you some inspiration for possible solutions, rather than nothing at all on those exercises. If you do find one, feel free to send a PR.
